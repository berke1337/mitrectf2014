First, extract the .vmdk from the .ova, and then use vmdktool [1] to turn it into a raw image.
Mount the image (read-only!!!) and do some simple forensics.
Find /home/georgesr/.bash_history , this talks about contract-documents.zip but it's gone...
We don't know the password to contract-documents.zip.nc...
No worries, we have the whole disk image, so find all potential zip headers using:
=> grep -a -b -o PK f300b.img > zipoff
Then, use zipreader.rb to try to read the zip headers, output the offsets for zip files with the word 'contract'.
Extract the zipfile from this offset and try to unzip... the supplied password doesn't work?
Search for other passwords in the disk image:
=> grep -a -b -o 'zip -P..................' ~/f300b.img
First match we already tried
Second match is the man page or something
Third uses some shell parameter, explore around this offset to find a wrapper script that appends frozenbananas to the supplied password.
Supply this to unzip to find the flag.
