There's a JS file that has to do with the login, download it.
First, use some online JS beautifier for good indenting.
Then copy the array on top into ruby (yay, same syntax!), and use it to replace all occurences of strings using replace_838e.rb
Check the login() function for the credentials, and after follow the leads in the page source a couple times to find the flag.
